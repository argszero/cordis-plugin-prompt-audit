/**
 * The versions this plugin is installed and exercised against. Each has had the
 * full suite run with *every* dsh dev dependency pinned to that single line
 * (install from the registry, build, `node --test`), not merely a surface grep:
 * 31/31 on all eight.
 *
 * One caveat, measured rather than assumed: pinning a *single* dsh package to
 * an older line inside an otherwise empty project does NOT resolve, because npm
 * then auto-installs this package's other peers at their newest versions, and
 * upstream's peers exclude older prereleases of their own tuple (dsh-agent@X
 * peers dsh-llm@^X). Verified both ways: with only one peer pinned it fails
 * with ERESOLVE naming *dsh-agent*, not this package; with the full peer set
 * pinned to that line - which is what a consumer on that line actually has - it
 * resolves cleanly and the packed artifact imports. So the failure belongs to
 * upstream's peer diamond, not to this range, and it is not reachable through
 * the supported user path `npm i @deepseek-ai/dsh@<line>`, which floats within
 * the tuple.

/**
 * Guard the peer range by *computing* admission, not by pattern-matching it.
 *
 * A semver comparator admits a prerelease only when some comparator in the same
 * group shares that prerelease's `major.minor.patch` tuple. The range this
 * package shipped before v0.1.1 -
 *
 *   ">=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0"
 *
 * - therefore admitted the 0.1.2-rc and 0.1.5 tuples and nothing else: the
 * `<0.2.0` upper bound never excludes a later tuple's prerelease, so it was
 * inert, and no comparator covered the 0.1.3 or 0.1.6 tuples. A user on the
 * newest shipped dsh release got
 *
 *   npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
 *
 * for a plugin whose own suite passes on that line. The dsh packages are
 * *peers*, so this cannot be papered over with `--legacy-peer-deps`: the
 * install simply fails.
 *
 * Asserting the admitted set *exactly* makes both failure directions loud - a
 * range that quietly drops a supported line fails the equality below, and a
 * range that quietly admits an untested line fails it too.
